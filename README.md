# Introduction to Machine Learning in Python

This repository is a fork of [Sundeep Rangan's](http://wireless.engineering.nyu.edu/sundeep-rangan/) 
original course material at [https://github.com/sdrangan/introml/](https://github.com/sdrangan/introml/).

It contains all the material for the Spring 2020 Introduction to Machine Learning course (CS-UY 4563) at NYU Tandon
taught by [Christopher Musco](https://www.chrismusco.com/). The main webpage for the course can be accessed 
at [https://www.chrismusco.com/introml/](https://www.chrismusco.com/introml/) and students should refer
there for primary information on lectures and assignments.
